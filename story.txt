Sunny and His Drums

Sunny got a pair of new drums and he is a pro at playing them. All his class mates are big fans of his music and that made Sunny famous.

Sam joins Sunny and they form a band of musicians. Jazz really wants to join them, but they are not ready to accept as he is not so good with music.
